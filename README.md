# Hello, I'm Cody ðŸ‘‹

I'm a (mostly) self-taught developer who enjoys working with JavaScript, Python, and C - I do most of my coding on macOS, WSL 2, [replit](https://replit.com), or on my Raspberry Pi. I'm excited by both old and new technologies - debugging C code with GNU Debugger and using HMR or Hydration in Svelte are both experiences that remind me why I love coding.

## Languages, Design Patterns, Libraries, etc.

I'm always learning new things - here are a few things I've used that I plan to stick with.

- TypeScript/JavaScript/Node.js
  - Express, Jest, Axios, Svelte
- Python
  - Requests, Beautiful Soup, Pytest, Django
- C
  - Make, C11, GNU Readline, GDB, pthreads, ncurses
- Bash/Zsh
- HTML, CSS
- Postgres, SQLite
- Regular Expressions
- async/await
- closures, decorators
- OOP, functional, imperative
- TDD

And some things I'm actively learning

- Redis
- Rust
- WebAssembly

## Personal/Private Projects

I keep most of my personal projects private, and I treat those projects somewhat like an [anti-library ðŸ“š](https://www.google.com/search?q=anti-library) - I get all my project ideas into a repository as quickly as I come up with them and then break those projects into small tasks that can easily be actioned. Having these small projects ready means that I never run out of ways to build experience and challenge my knowledge.
